This repository contains the group report me and my group had done up for our HSI2005 project, as well as my individual report for the module.

Our project required us to survey NUS students regarding the use of AI in daily lives and afterwards we were to determine the effectiveness of AI physically and emotionally.

The general consensus of the report was that AI is increasingly more effective by physical means but there are still gaps to be covered for emotional needs.
